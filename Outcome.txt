Designing Applications and Architecture in AWS
Course-end Project

				Real-time Data Management


			Objectives
 To deploying infrastructure for real-time data management 
requirements on the AWS Cloud offers a scalable, flexible, 
and cost-effective solution for organizations aiming to 
harness the power of real-time data processing. 

			Motivation
 Problem Statement: 
You are given a project to create data in a Kinesis stream that can be 
copied to the DynamoDB database
 Real-World Scenario:
 TELEMAX is a company that plans to build networks in rapidly growing, 
underserved markets around the world. The company offers 
innovative communications hardware that enables them to create 
many speed-efficient networking links with inexpensive hardware.
 Presently, they need, to deploy an effective architecture for NoSQL
based data warehousing built from real-time data being generated that 
can be analyzed in the future to optimize their topologies continuously. 
The team decided the AWS cloud is the perfect environment to support 
their solution needs and they will approach your organization for 
consultation on the same.
